**DSA Preparation Checklist**

To build strong fundamentals in Data Structures and Algorithms, you should implement the following data structures and algorithms from scratch. For each, start with an empty class/template and write all the core methods yourself—no library shortcuts.

Data Structures to Implement

1. Arrays
	•	Fixed-size array class (insert, delete, get, set)

2. Linked Lists
	•	Singly Linked List (append, prepend, insert, delete, get, set)
	•	Doubly Linked List (append, prepend, insert, delete, get, set)

3. Stacks
	•	Stack using array
	•	Stack using linked list

4. Queues
	•	Queue using array
	•	Queue using linked list
	•	Circular queue

5. Hash Tables
	•	Hash map with basic collision handling (chaining or open addressing)

6. Trees
	•	Binary Tree (insert, delete, traversals: inorder, preorder, postorder)
	•	Binary Search Tree (insert, delete, search)
	•	AVL Tree or Red-Black Tree (basic balancing)
	•	Heap (min-heap and max-heap: insert, delete, heapify)
	•	Trie (insert, search, delete)

7. Graphs
	•	Graph using adjacency list (add/remove vertex/edge, BFS, DFS)
	•	Graph using adjacency matrix

8. Disjoint Set (Union-Find)
	•	Make set, find, union (with path compression and union by rank)

Algorithms to Implement

1. Sorting Algorithms
	•	Bubble Sort
	•	Selection Sort
	•	Insertion Sort
	•	Merge Sort
	•	Quick Sort
	•	Heap Sort
	•	Counting/Radix/Bucket Sort (optional)

2. Searching Algorithms
	•	Linear Search
	•	Binary Search (iterative and recursive)

3. Recursion & Backtracking
	•	Factorial, Fibonacci (recursive and iterative)
	•	N-Queens, Subsets, Permutations

4. Dynamic Programming Basics
	•	Memoization and Tabulation examples (e.g., Fibonacci, Coin Change, Knapsack)

5. Graph Algorithms
	•	BFS and DFS (both iterative and recursive)
	•	Dijkstra’s Algorithm
	•	Kruskal’s and Prim’s Minimum Spanning Tree
	•	Topological Sort
	•	Cycle detection

Practice Template

For each data structure/algorithm:
	•	Start with an empty class or function definition.
	•	Write all core methods (insert, delete, search, etc.) from scratch.
	•	Add a str or print method to visualize the structure.
	•	Test with basic example cases.

Tip: Avoid using built-in data structure methods (like Python’s list methods beyond basic indexing) to maximize your learning.
